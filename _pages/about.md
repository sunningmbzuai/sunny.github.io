I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Vision at MBZUAI, supervised by Professor [Le Song](https://dasongle.github.io/). I also work closely with Professor [Eric Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) on the Multiscale Biological Foundation Model project. Since my second year, I have been collaborating with Ericâ€™s group at CMU, where I also completed a three-month exchange visit during the summer.

Prior to joining MBZUAI, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). During my final year as an undergraduate, I completed a one-year internship at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), where I worked on visual generalization based on NUWA model and optimization of LightGBM.


Research Interests
======
My research interests span the intersection of AI and Life Sciences. My current focus is on AI for Molecular and Phenotypic Biology. Specifically, I am working on building foundation models for biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and proteins, and integrating these models with phenotype signals for clinical and disease diagnosis applications.

Additionally, I am one of the main contributors to the AIDO platform. AIDO is an interactive AI-powered toolkit designed to enable researchers to simulate biological phenomena across multiple scales.
